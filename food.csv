"1","Chicken Halang-halang Recipe","<p>You will not have a hard time cooking Chicken Halang-halang because this is really a simple dish. Start by heating the cooking oil in a cooking pot &mdash; I use canola oil most of the time. Once the oil gets hot, it is time to saute our three commonly used ingredients: garlic, onion, and ginger.</p>

<p>You will know that the chicken is ready to be added once the onion starts to soften. Gently add the chicken pieces and then continue to cook one side until it turns brown. You can use tongs to check on these. Turn the chicken over to cook the other side and then pour the coconut milk. Let it boil and add the lemongrass, papaya, and chili. At this point, cover the cooking pot and set your heat to medium. We will need to cook the chicken further while extracting the flavor from the papaya and lemongrass.</p>

<p>Once the chicken is done, add ground black pepper, fish sauce (you may use salt as an alternative), and more chili, if preferred. Lastly, put the hot pepper leaves in. You can use malunggay leaves or even spinach as alternative ingredients.</p>

"2","SISIG RECIPE USING PORK BELLY","<h2>WHAT IS SISIG?</h2>

<p>Sisig is probably the most famous Kapampangan dish in the Philippines that is also gaining a lot of attention worldwide.&nbsp; You would easily&nbsp;find it in the menus of&nbsp;most restaurants, bars, or even common small food stalls called, Carinderias.</p>

<p>The Sisig that most people know is a modern-day version of what it was in earlier years. The Kapampangan word &#39;sisig&#39; actually means to snack on something sour (normally unripe fruit in vinegar dressing).&nbsp; It was originally a very sour dish because of all the vinegar and/or calamansi juice in it. It was not until later that pork or other meat was used.</p>

<p>Sisig was re-invented and became what it is today, thanks to the ingenious thinking of Lucia Cunanan a.k.a.&quot;Aling Lucing&quot; who served it in her carinderia in Angeles City. She thought of a way to make use of the pigs&#39; heads that would rather be thrown away by the commissaries who prepared the meals for the American troops when they occupied the Clark Airbase. It became quite popular as &quot;pulutan&quot; or beer-food in this late-night joint. Later on, the idea of serving it on a sizzling plate was introduced by a rival,&nbsp;Benedicto Pamintuan. Not one to be left behind, Aling Lucing also started to serve her sisig in the same manner.</p>

<p>n Pampanga, it is also common to eat it as a viand, to be eaten with rice. But as a &quot;pulutan&#39; it is normally served on a sizzling plate and in other areas topped with raw egg. This, however, is not a norm in Pampanga and definitely no mayonnaise.</p>

<p>There are also several variations&nbsp;of the original pork sisig these days, like chicken sisig, tuna sisig, and squid sisig to name some.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have tried different kinds of Sisig from all over the country. The one from Pampanga, with or without the sizzling plate, plain and simple without all the extra trimming,&nbsp; is still the best in my humble opinion. I don&#39;t say that because I am from Pampanga, but it is just a known fact.</p>

<h2>HOW TO MAKE AUTHENTIC YET EASY PORK SISIG?</h2>

<p>The process of making the popular present-day Kapampangan Sisig involves boiling and then grilling the meat. It is then chopped into fine bits&nbsp;and the rest of ingredients are added. Grilled chicken liver is also added for flavor and creaminess.</p>

<p>This is not as saucy like the ones they make restaurants, nor does it contain mayonnaise and the ingredients are so much more simple.</p>

<p>To make it more authentic, you can use pig mask and ears. But I chose to use pork belly for this recipe. That way, Armin can also eat it. It also tastes very similar but not as fatty. I skipped the boiling part and just marinated the belly before grilling.&nbsp;You don&#39;t want to overcook the meat by cooking it 3 times (boiling, grilling, pan-frying, or sizzling) to avoid it from getting dry unlike when you are using pig&#39;s head which has more fats in it that&nbsp;can withstand long and various stages of cooking.</p>","2","3","2021-01-21 06:56:36","2021-01-21 14:18:29"

"6","Puto Pao","<p>Puto Pao is a type of special&nbsp;<a href=""https://panlasangpinoy.com/butter-puto/"">puto</a>&nbsp;with meat filling. I made it extra special by topping it with salted egg. This is easy to make. Your family will love it.</p>

<h2>How to Make</h2>

<p>It is easy and fun to make puto pao at home. You can have this as a snack, or make profit out of it. The choice is yours.</p>

<p>Start making one by preparing the asado filling. We are literally making sweet pork asado. I do this by saut&eacute;ing onion until tender. The next step is adding sliced pork pieces. I am using pork shoulder (kasim) for this recipe. Cook the pork while stirring until it turns light brown. Season it with soy sauce and add water.</p>

<p>This needs to boil until tender. The minute that the water boils, star anise is added. This ingredient gives the dish additional flavor and fragrance. Continue cooking on a covered pot for 30 to 35 minutes in low heat.</p>

<p>Once the pork gets tender, you can remove the star anise and add brown sugar. I season it with ground black pepper and Knorr Liquid Seasoning.</p>

<p>Make the sauce thicker by pouring slurry into the pot. Simply combine cornstarch with 3 to 4 tablespoons water and then pour the mixture. Continue cooking until the mixture gets thick. You now have your filling ready.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start making the batter. This is quick and easy as well. Combine all the dry ingredients in a large bowl. This includes all the flour, sugar, and baking powder. Mix it using a wire whisk.</p>

<p>Add the wet ingredients next. Crack a piece of egg into the bowl and then pour milk, water, and melted butter. Mix until the mixture becomes smooth. That&rsquo;s it! We are now ready to assemble the puto pao and steam it.</p>

<p>Steaming is the preferred way of cooking this dish. If you are using a regular steamer, make sure to start boiling water while assembling the puto.</p>

<p>Grab a piece of mold and then pour one tablespoon of batter. Scoop around 1 to 1 1/2 teaspoons of pork asado and put it into the mold. Cover with puto batter until the mold is around three quarters full.</p>

<p>I like having this with sliced salted egg on top.&nbsp; So, I prepare it before steaming. Slice egg into half and then separate it from the shell using a spoon. Slice it into thin pieces afterwards. Watching the video below will help because I showed the exact way on how it is done.</p>

<p>This steams for 15 minutes. However, since it needs to be topped with salted egg, you have to be aware of the timing. After 2 to 3 minutes of steaming, top it with sliced egg. Continue steaming until it reaches the 15 minute mark.</p>

<p>Serve this as a snack. It also makes a good breakfast as far as I am concerned. I usually keep it in the fridge for at least 5 days. I can always heat it in the microwave oven when I want one, or two for that matter.</p>

<h2>How to Cook Kung Pao Shrimp</h2>

<p>Start by saut&eacute;ing ginger and garlic. Do this by heating oil on a pan. Add the ginger first, followed by the garlic.&nbsp; Quickly stir-in dried chili pepper and peanuts. These cooks for a good one minute.</p>

<p>Add onion and zucchini. Stir fry for 1 minute, and then add bell pepper. You can use any color of bell pepper. I utilized red for this particular recipe.</p>

<p>Add the shrimp next. Continue to stir-fry for 2 minutes or until shrimp turns orange. You can pour the sauce afterwards.&nbsp;I got the kung pao sauce from my local grocery store. This might not be always available in your local supermarkets, so that mean you have to make one from scratch if this happens (see link above for details).</p>

<p>Finish this off by adding the scallions and seasonings. I love having this with&nbsp;Yang Chow Fried rice.</p>
